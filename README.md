# JuceDistortions
This is my first project made eith JUCE framework.

---

This Repository contains a simple Distortion implemented on [JUCE Framework](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) for the development of audio applications.

On the `master` branch I developed the ***ToyiDistortion*** (Toyi is my father, he is guitarrist).

This are the maths behind: [Geogebra/ToyiDistortion](https://www.geogebra.org/m/kaccdhua)

On the `ale` branch I developed the ***AM - 37*** it's a little variation of ToyiDistortion for my friend Alejandro Marasso.

This are the maths behind: [Geogebra/AleDistortion](https://www.geogebra.org/m/mmkmswrn)
